# The Quantum Universe
Welcome to the Quantum Universe.  Taking inspiration from Desiree Vogt-Lee's absolutely fantastic "Awesome Quantum Computing" repository of materials, I will be writing down all the resources I use and come across as I explore Quantum Space, which will include: <br />
- quantum computing, 
- quantum algorithms,
- quantum hardware,
- mathematics, 
- quantum mechanics, 
- quantum information, 
- cosmology,
- quantum gravity,
- string theory,
- and more.  <br />

In other words, this is designed to be the ultimate directory of resources for all things quantum.  This is open for all people to use and if you've got a suggestion for me to add or modify sections, just send it my way and I'll look at it.

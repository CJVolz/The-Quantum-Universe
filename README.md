# The Quantum Universe
Taking inspiration from Desiree Vogt-Lee's absolutely fantastic "Awesome Quantum Computing" repository of materials, I will be writing down all the resources I use and come across as I explore Quantum Space.  This is open for all people to use and if you've got a suggestion, just send it my way and I'll look at it.

# Update List
Copied from README.md: <br />

And to conclude, the final list in this project is the update list, where I describe the development of this project in far too much detail, with newest first to the oldest event last.  All times are EST (unless I move, which then I shall accordingly update here.  <br />

**Sessions** <br />
8/2/2020 at various times and 8/3/2020 12:00 Midnight - 5:30 AM  <br />
Set up the README.md doc as the first and last thing done before quitting for the day/night/whatever.  Created a [Google Sheets doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F5F9sVB8MaYu_CAxqtWrJmfuX2iSuSUka8u2EXVg5fg/edit?usp=sharing) to open source the collection of online communities and to provide a method of community-driven updates on the info regarding such communities.  Created the pages and linked them to the README.md doc.  Used most of the info to fill in the Community.md document, which is now mostly complete until more communities are discovered.  Discovered that I needed a company and organisation page, since those communities aren't like the ones listed on the Community.md doc.  Left a few sources on the Google Sheets doc for the next date of filling in data (Qftics for the blogs, Qiskit for the companies, and missing info on the others). As the last thing I did, created a page to store these updates and then released the repository link on the Google Sheet.  <br /> <br />

Created repository, set up license stuff (which honestly may not even be the right one to use), and a few of the docs (Community, Organisations, Social Media, News and Blogs, Books).
